## Divisibility

> There is a set of names for results: A **theorem** is an important result that is usually one of the highlights of the subject. A **proposition** is an important result, but not as important as a theorem. A **lemma** is a result that helps to prove a proposition or a theorem. It is often singled out because it is useful and interesting in its own right. A **corollary** is a result that is an easy consequence of a theorem or proposition.

### Definition 2.1

Given two integers $a$ and $d$ with d **non-zero**, we say that $d$ divides $a$ (written $d \mid a$) if there is an integer $c$ with $a = cd$. If no such integer exists, so $d$ does not divide $a$, we write $d \nmid a$. If $d$ divides $a$, we say that $d$ is a **divisor** of $a$.

### Proposition 2.2

Assume that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers. If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$, then $a \mid c$.
