what is the pre-kownlogy of  Fourier Transform

The precursor to Fourier Transform is Fourier Series. Fourier Series is a mathematical technique that represents a periodic function as a sum of sine and cosine waves. It was developed by Joseph Fourier in the early 19th century. Fourier Series was used to solve various problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering.

Fourier Transform is an extension of Fourier Series that allows us to analyze non-periodic functions, such as signals and images. It was developed by Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier in the early 19th century. Fourier Transform has become an essential tool in many fields, including signal processing, image processing, and quantum mechanics.
