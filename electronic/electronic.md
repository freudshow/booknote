结温（Junction Temperature）

`Junction temperature`, short for `transistor junction` temperature,  is the highest operating temperature of the actual semiconductor in an electronic device. In operation, it is higher than case temperature and the temperature of the part's exterior. The difference is equal to the amount of heat transferred from the junction to case multiplied by the junction-to-case thermal resistance.

Junction - 交叉口, 如铁路的轨道交叉口, 公路的交叉口等

ambient - 环境的
